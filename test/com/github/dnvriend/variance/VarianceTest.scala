   *
   * ==Overview==
   * The type system of many programming languages support subtyping. For instance, if Cat is subtype of Animal,
   * then an expression of type Cat can be used whenever an expression of type Animal could.
   *
   * Variance refers to how subtyping between more complex types, container types or more precise, higher kinded types,
   * like T[A], (eg. List[Cat] vs List[Animal]) relates to subtyping. Depending on the variance of the type constructor,
   * the subtyping relation may be either preserved, reversed, or ignored.
   *
   * Variance is a way of declaring how type parameters can be changed to create conformant types.
   *
   * A higher-kinded type T[A] is said to conform to T[B] if you can assign T[B] to T[A] without causing any errors.
   *
   * The rules of variance govern the type conformance of types with parameters. Variance takes three forms:
   * invariance T[A], covariance T[+A] , and contravariance T[-A].

   * A higher-kinded type that’s invariant implies that for any types T, A, and B if T[A] conforms to T[B] then A must
   * be the equivalent type of B. You can’t change the type parameter of T. Invariance is the default for any
   * higher-kinded type parameter.

   * ''Covariance T[+A] refers to the ability to substitute a type parameter with its parent type'';
   * For any types T, A and B if T[A] conforms to T[B] then A <: B
   *
   * The Mammal and Cat relationship is such that the Cat type conforms to the Mammal type; if a method requires
   * something of type Mammal, a value of type Cat could be used. If a type T were defined as covariant, then the type
   * T[Cat] would conform to the type T[Mammal]: A method requiring a T[Mammal] would accept a value of type T[Cat].
   *
   * The conformance of T is the same (co-) as the conformance of its type parameters. The easiest example of this is
   * a list, which is higher-kinded on the type of its elements. You could have a list of strings or a list of integers.
   *
   * Because Any is a supertype of String, we can use a list of strings where a list of Any is expected.
   *
   * Creating a Covariant parameter is as easy as adding a + symbol before the type parameter; T[+A].
   *
   * When we declare List[+A], we are saying that List is covariant in the parameter A. What that means is that it
   * takes a type, say Parent, to a new type List[Parent], and if Child is a subtype of Parent,
   * then List[Child] will be a `subtype` of List[Parent].

   *
   * If the type T is defined as contravariant, then a method expecting a type of T[Cat] would accept a value of type T[Mammal].
   * Notice that the direction of the conformance relationship is opposite (contra-) that of the Mammal--Cat relationship.
   *
   * Contravariance can be harder to reason through but makes sense in the context of a Function object. A Function object
   * is covariant on the return type and contravariant on the argument type. Intuitively this makes sense. You can take the
   * return value of a function and cast it to any supertype of that return value. As for arguments, you can pass any subtype
   * of the argument type. You should be able to take a function of Any => String and cast it to a String => Any but not vice versa.
